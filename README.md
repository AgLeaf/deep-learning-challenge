-The non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup wants to create an algorithm to predict whether or not applicants for
 funding will be successful. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features
 in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be
 successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

-Included are two python notebooks for Steps 1-4, the original charity_data.csv, and the two resulting HDF5 files.
